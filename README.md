# Create simple neural networks from scratch

## Complicated Neural Network

Contains input, output and hiddens (as much as you like) layers.
Use sigmoid activation function.

## Linear Neural Network

Contains input, output and hiddens (as much as you like) layers,
but use linear function unlike previous layers in output.
Previous layers use sigmoid activation function.

## Simple Neural Network

Contains just three layers - input, output and hidden (just one).
Use sigmoid activation function.
